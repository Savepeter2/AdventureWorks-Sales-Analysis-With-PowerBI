# AdventureWorks-Sales-Analysis-With-PowerBI

In This project, I analyzed the AdventureWorks Sales dataset with Microsoft PowerBI,
The steps I took are as follows: 

Step 1: Extracted Data
Step 2: Transformed Data
Step 3: Load Data
Step 4: Data Modeling
Step 5: Writing DAX
Step 6: Publish Report
Step 7: Dashboard Creation
Step 8: Share & Collaborate.

First, I cleaned up the data, made some required transformations, then I explored the relationships and DAX in the data such as connecting my LOOKUP tables and DATA tables together which made up my model. 
This is a snapshot of my connected tables

Then I explored some DAX(Data analysis Expressions) such as getting the Total Sales Amount($) using a calculated column, got new explicit measures such as variance, variance% e.t.c. The model comprises of the relationships and data analysis expressions. 

Lastly, I visualized the data, where Insights from the visualizations were gotten. 

Insights derived are as follows:

ðŸš©The total sales made by the company throughout the period was about $29.3M which became higher than the companyâ€™s budget of $16.9M. A positive growth for the company.

ðŸš©The Bikes category had the highest sales and highest budget.

ðŸš©The Sales and Budget exhibited the same trend by month ,where the highest sales and budget were made in June.

ðŸš©Customers with professional and skilled jobs generated the highest sales for the company, because they receive a very high yearly income, professional jobs being the highest and skilled jobs being the third highest.

ðŸš©The highest sales were generated in Australia and SouthWest region.
